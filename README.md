# Cosmic-Curation

Cosmic Curration is a fast-paced space shooting game that immerses players in an action-packed interstellar battle. The game features a variety of power-ups, formidable enemies, and intense laser shooting mechanics, delivering everything one would expect from a classic space shooter.

## Key Features:

**Power-ups:** Enhance your spaceship's abilities and gain an edge over your enemies.

**Enemies:** Face off against a diverse array of adversaries, each with unique behaviors and 
challenges.

**Laser Shooting:** Engage in thrilling laser battles with responsive and dynamic shooting mechanics.

## Unique Implementation:

The standout feature of Cosmic Curration is the implementation of Object Pooling using Unity. Object pooling is a design pattern that significantly improves performance by reusing existing objects instead of frequently creating and destroying them. This approach minimizes the CPU's workload by reducing repetitive create and destroy calls.

## Object Pooling in Action:

**Lasers:** Reuse laser objects to maintain a smooth and consistent shooting experience.

**Enemies:** Efficiently manage enemy spawns and despawns to keep the gameplay fluid and responsive.

## Learning Experience:

Implementing object pooling was both a challenge and a valuable learning opportunity. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of performance optimization in Unity and honed my skills in efficient game development practices.

Cosmic Curration not only showcases my ability to create engaging gameplay but also highlights my proficiency in advanced Unity techniques, making it a significant milestone in my game development journey.
